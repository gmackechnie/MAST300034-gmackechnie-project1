# Directory
- 'appplied ds project 1.ipynb': contains all code for the project. It is broken down sequentially into blocks, so running these in order will reproduce the same output.
- `raw_data`: Contains all the raw data files (except for the taxi dataset)
- `plots`: Output and save all your figures here.
